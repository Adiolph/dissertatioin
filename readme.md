# Doctoral Dissertation

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my doctoral dissertation, "Optimizing the Next Generation Deep Sea Neutrino Telescope." 
It describes the simulation framework build for TRIDENT and the detector performance study results. 
It also serves as a guidebook for running simulation programs in TRIDENT. 

Within this repository, you will find the full text of my dissertation and its source resources such as figures and references that may be useful to readers interested in this field. 

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!
